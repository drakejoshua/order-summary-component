## My process
Firstly had to mark up the whole html and then applied a stylesheet. Didn't know about the style guide until now so fonts and colors may not correspond with what was in the style guide as i originally thought we were to use our discretion.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Majorly, I learn't more about the grid layout and how it can work in accordance with responsive web design.
Also, i also learnt more on how i can optimize the use of opacity and display layout

### Continued development

I want to learn how to do better responsive design
